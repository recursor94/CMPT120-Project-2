This is a simple javascript prototype for a text adventure game. The user will navigate through an
imaginary space freighter as an intergalactic space ambassador on an important diplomatic journey.
The spaceship has not arrived at its destination yet, but the user may still grab a bite at the
kitchen, explore the long corridors of the residential sector, head to the presentation room
or relax in his room. The choice is yours.
